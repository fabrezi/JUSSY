# JUSSY
writing JS spaghetti code.

### JS

The name JavaScript is redundant and confusing. I call it Nodes. 
Nodes has become imperative for modern Mobile/Web design.


JS is known as black ducktape language of the internet era. It is the adpoted child of Perl. Is JS for the good or bad for prorgramming; only time will tell.
