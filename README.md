# JUSSY
writing JS spaghetti code.

### JS

The name JavaScript is redundant and confusing. I call it Nodes. 
Nodes has become imperative for modern Mobile/Web design.


JS is known as black ducktape language of the internet era. It is the adpoted child of Perl. If JS for the good or bad for prorgramming; only time will tell.

## new questions

algorithms are setup to describe a portion of following problems to be solved.

js concepts --> alg basics --> .. some questions I seen in coding interviews:

- [xo]: its a more like if there is x then it is off. Else if it is o then
        its on. some like in that portion. how would you code.
- [sort]: do any kind of sort.
- [word-counter]: count the number of times the word `the` occurs in a sentence.
- [binary-search]: a classic question.
- [hamming]: make a word search alg.  (advance)**
- [quicksort]: a classic hemmy here!!
